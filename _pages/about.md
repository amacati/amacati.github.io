I am a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) working at the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab (LSY) supervised by Prof. Angela Schoellig. I am interested in all things deep reinforcement learning, be it in robotics, gaming, or plain theory, and its application to robot manipulation. As a side project, I train RL agents in Dark Souls III and Elden Ring.

Before joining LSY I spent some time at Huawei Research working on Deep RL for neural motion planning and imitation learning for robotic insertion of objects. I received my master’s degree from TUM in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology.

**Student Theses** I am open to supervising ambitious and talented master’s and bachelor’s students for their thesis. If you want to work with me, please send me an email describing your area of interest. Please also attach your CV and up-to-date transcripts.
